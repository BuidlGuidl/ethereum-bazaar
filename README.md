# Marketplace Mini App

Farcaster-ready marketplace mini app built on Scaffold-ETH 2. It lets creators publish fixed-price listings payable in ETH or ERC-20, buyers purchase them trustlessly, and both parties leave on-chain EAS reviews. The app ships with a modular contract design, a Next.js frontend wired to SE-2 hooks, and optional indexing via Ponder.

## What‚Äôs inside
- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router), Wagmi/Viem, RainbowKit, SE-2 components and hooks. Farcaster Mini App integration (Quick Auth, splash handling).
- **Contracts**: `Marketplace`, `IListingType`, `SimpleListings`, and local `TestERC20` tokens for dev.
- **Reviews**: EAS review schema registered automatically on local and known networks; config is emitted for frontend and indexer.
- **Indexer**: Ponder project to index marketplace and review activity.

## Farcaster Mini App integration
- The mini app calls `sdk.actions.ready()` after the app is mounted to dismiss the splash screen (see `packages/nextjs/components/MiniappProvider.tsx`).
- Authenticated requests can be made with `sdk.quickAuth.fetch` or by pulling a token via `sdk.quickAuth.getToken` on the client and sending it to your backend. See Farcaster Mini App docs for validation on the server using `@farcaster/quick-auth`.

## Contracts architecture

### Roles and components
- **Marketplace.sol**: Router/orchestrator that stores pointers to listings and delegates operations to a pluggable listing-type contract implementing `IListingType`.
- **IListingType.sol**: Minimal interface that listing-types implement: `create`, `handleAction`, and `getListing`.
- **SimpleListings.sol**: A concrete `IListingType` for fixed-price listings payable in ETH or an ERC-20.
- **TestERC20.sol**: Simple mintable tokens for local development (2 and 6 decimals). Only deployed on `localhost`/`hardhat`.

### Marketplace data model
- `listingCount`: sequential marketplace-level IDs starting at 1 (also used as the listing-type ID).
- `listings[id]`: `ListingPointer { creator, listingType, contenthash, active }` where:
  - `listingType` is the address of the listing-type contract (e.g., `SimpleListings`).
  - `contenthash` is an arbitrary string (e.g., IPFS CID) set at creation time.
  - `active` tracks whether the listing can accept actions like `buy`.

### Lifecycle and how contracts interact
1) **Create**: `Marketplace.createListing(listingType, contenthash, data)`
   - Calls `IListingType(listingType).create(msg.sender, id, data)` where `id` is the new marketplace ID.
   - Stores `ListingPointer` and emits `ListingCreated(id, creator, listingType, id, contenthash)`.

2) **Actions**: `Marketplace.callAction(id, action, data)`
   - Delegates to `IListingType.handleAction(listingId=id, creator, active, caller=msg.sender, action, data)`.
   - `action` is the 4-byte function selector (left-padded to 32 bytes) of a function exposed by the listing-type for dynamic dispatch.
   - Emits `ListingAction(id, caller, action)`.

3) **Activation toggle**
   - Only the listing-type can toggle `active` via `Marketplace.setActive(id, active)`.
   - Emits `ListingActivationChanged(id, active)`.

### SimpleListings data and behavior
- Stored as `SimpleListing { paymentToken, price }` mapped by `listingId` (the marketplace ID).
- `paymentToken == address(0)`: buyer pays in ETH by sending exactly `price` wei; ETH is forwarded to the creator.
- `paymentToken != address(0)`: buyer pays in ERC-20; buyer must approve the `SimpleListings` contract to spend `price` tokens; no ETH accepted in this path.
- On successful sale: calls `Marketplace.setActive(listingId, false)`, emits `SimpleListingSold(listingId, buyer, price, paymentToken)`.
- Closing: only the marketplace-level `creator` may close; deactivates and emits `SimpleListingClosed(listingId, caller)`.

### Encoding and views
- `createListing(listingType, contenthash, data)` forwards `data` to the listing-type.
  - For `SimpleListings`, `data` must be `abi.encode(address paymentToken, uint256 price)`.
- `getListing(id)` returns `(creator, listingType, contenthash, active, listingData)` where `listingData` is `IListingType(listingType).getListing(id)`.
- For `SimpleListings.getListing(listingId)`, `listingData` is `abi.encode(paymentToken, price)`.

### Events
- Marketplace: `ListingCreated(uint256 id, address creator, address listingType, uint256 listingId, string contenthash)`, `ListingAction(uint256 id, address caller, bytes32 action)`, `ListingActivationChanged(uint256 listingId, bool active)`.
- SimpleListings: `SimpleListingCreated`, `SimpleListingSold`, `SimpleListingClosed`.

### Calling actions from the frontend
- With SE-2 hooks, write to `Marketplace.callAction` and pass a selector for the action you want. For example, to buy a listing with ETH using `SimpleListings`:

```ts
// selector for: buy(uint256,address,bool,address,bytes)
const action = '0x9570e8f9' as const; // bytes4; pass left-padded to 32 bytes
await writeMarketplaceAsync({
  functionName: 'callAction',
  args: [listingId, action, '0x'],
  value: priceWei, // only when paymentToken == address(0)
});
```

## EAS Reviews
- A review schema `uint256 listingId,uint8 rating,string commentIPFSHash` is registered by `packages/hardhat/deploy/05_register_review_schema.ts` on local and known networks.
- After deployment, config is written to:
  - Frontend: `packages/nextjs/contracts/easConfig.json`
  - Indexer: `packages/indexer/src/easConfig.json`
- Use these addresses/UIDs from your app or indexer to submit and query review attestations.

## Local development
1. Start a local chain:
   - `yarn chain`
2. Deploy contracts (Marketplace, SimpleListings):
   - `yarn deploy`
3. (Optional) Deploy local EAS core + register review schema:
   - `yarn deploy --tags EASLocal,ReviewSchema`
4. (Optional) Deploy local test tokens:
   - `yarn deploy --tags TestERC20`
5. Start the frontend:
   - `yarn start` ‚Üí `http://localhost:3000`

Contract artifacts/addresses are available under `packages/hardhat/deployments/<network>/`. The frontend uses SE-2‚Äôs generated `deployedContracts.ts` wiring for reads/writes.

## Frontend contract interactions (SE-2 way)
- Reads: `useScaffoldReadContract({ contractName, functionName, args })`
- Writes: `useScaffoldWriteContract({ contractName })` ‚Üí `writeContractAsync({ functionName, args, value? })`
- Events: `useScaffoldEventHistory({ contractName, eventName, watch? })`

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v20.18.3)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-ETH 2, follow the steps below:

1. Install dependencies if it was skipped in CLI:

```
cd my-dapp-example
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

Run smart contract test with `yarn hardhat:test`

- Edit your smart contracts in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
- Edit your frontend homepage at `packages/nextjs/app/page.tsx`. For guidance on [routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and configuring [pages/layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) checkout the Next.js documentation.
- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`
